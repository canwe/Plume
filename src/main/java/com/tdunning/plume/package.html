<h1>Plume</h1>
Plume is an independent implementation of a system similar to FlumeJava.  It allows map-reduce
programs to be written easily with little regard for whether they will ultimately be executed
in a parallel or sequential fashion.
<p>
In order to write a Plume program, you need a Plume object to work with.  This Plume defines
the execution model of your program and there will ultimately be varieties of Plumes that
execute code in local or parallel fashion, with or without Hadoop, and in eager
and lazy fashion.  So far, there is part of a local, eager Plume.

The <a href="http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/flumejava-easy-efficient-data-parallel-pipelines-wwPgFt2hWB">FlumeJava</a> paper provides an excellent introduction to the concepts.
With that paper in mind this code should be fairly simple.  The highest level structure is summarized by
the following classes:
<ul>
    <li>@see plume.local.eager.LocalPlume</li>
</ul>
